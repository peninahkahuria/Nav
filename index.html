           I wasn’t always as confident as you think I appear to be. My High School experience wasn’t the greatest and although I used to very much try to ‘do my own thing’ in terms of music and fashion, finding my feet socially and emotionally was never as easy. Through School, College, University and beyond, there has always naturally been self doubt in my abilities, but with the support of others and their own confidence in me, I feel my certainty in my own skills has started to shine.When I started Inthefrow I was absolutely terrified about what others would think of me. Would people even read what I wrote, would they care at all and more importantly for me at the time, would I be trolled? As the years have gone by and as I have spilled more of myself out onto the Internet, my confidence has grown and I no longer worry about the things I used to worry about. I think I will always have a little self doubt and I hope that is what will keep me grounded and not allow my tenacity and courage to appear as a form of arrogance. I think I’m far too Northern for any of that.There are several places from which I’ve gained my confidence over time and I find myself learning every day to believe in what I do. I do work hard and I do believe that anyone can be successful in whatever they put their mind to, including myself, and that is down to the experiences and the people we surround ourselves with

          Christianity was one of the things introduced by colonies that spread all over Africa and made a great impact in people since most of them transformed to becoming Christians and it became their greatest religion that had the highest number of people. Christianity made a good impact since its teachings were teaching on good morals and good behaviors of Christians.Education was never valued in Africa since they believed in children being taught by their elders instead of going to school. The colonies changed that perception by introducing education in Africa which made a huge impact since   Africans started valuing education and reduced illiteracy which enhanced them in getting job opportunities in higher ranks.Whenever we have some positive impacts we cant lack some bad impacts too,some western culture were inherited by africans that impacted them in a negative way,some negative ways were like the dressing code,before the colonialists came africans dressed descently but after the colonialist Africans adopted their way of dressing which was out of the African culture
